If you know what RSS is then here's the [link](/index.xml)

RSS is a type of web feed. It allows you to consume website content, like a blog's post or podcast's episodes, by fetching a file from the website that contains its published content. 

By fetching this file every day (for example), you could keep up-to-date with the website's new content.
